## CHANGES:
1.0 First release.
1.1 Small fix in project simplex code.


## ABOUT:
This is the authors' implementation of [1].

The code is implemented in MATLAB:
  compile.m                 - a script to check all dependencies
  demoSupResPALM.m          - a demo script that executes the algorithm
  SupResPALM.m              - the core part of the algorithm
  pompoms_ms.mat            - a sample image of the CAVE database (in 2D format)
  ./include/                - various dependecies (hyperspectal toolbox)
  ./reproject_simplex/      - Projection onto a Simplex (T. Pock)
  ./sisal/                  - SISAL/SUnSAL folder, files must be downloaded
  LICENSE                   - MIT license of the code
  README                    - this file



## IMPORTANT:
If you use this software you should cite the following in any resulting
publication:

## INSTALLING & RUNNING:
Start MATLAB and run compile.m to build the utilities binaries.
This step can be omitted if you are using Windows 64 bit or Unix 64 bit,
since the binaries already exist.
However, you still need the SISAL/SUnSAL package.
